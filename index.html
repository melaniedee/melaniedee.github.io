<h1> ME!!* </h1>
		<p class="paragraph">HI!! I live on a ranch with lots of <u>animals</u>. I have 7 siblings. My dad is a rancher and runs sheep, and cattle. I have an uncle that makes a cool product called Wool Pellets. Something cool about my family is most of my cousins live in the same town. We have <b>1 dog, who had 9 puppies</b> in her 1st batch then 2 died, then in her next batch, she had 9, all of them lived! yay!! We have 10 barn cats, 10 to many for me, (I am starting to hate cats! Ours are all strays.) and I think we have 20 chickens. Also, just the other day, <i>a mink</i> got into our chickens and killed around 9 of them. It was very sad.</p>
